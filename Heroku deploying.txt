Now we are going to deploy in heroku so for that we naeed to login into the heroku and later we have to create a pproject
After creating project we have to connect the GitHub and we have to check the brach of github which is been added
To Deploy my code in GitHub i sfferd a lot cause initially i have rtried to deploy Section7 later i have tried to deploy
the whle flask uedmy folder then i got error of clashing the repositories
So Faizan bhai helped me to add venv and .data files to gitignore file and he removed .data file so that it conatin some unnessary files
he used the command of git rm -rf --cache .data
Again he added git add .
then git commit -am "updtaes"
git push
