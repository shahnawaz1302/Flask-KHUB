What happend in waht video:
    In 93rd video we have created two folders in code folder named as resources and models and we have created __init___.py files in two of them
    In that video itself we have moved user.py and item.py files into resources because the classes present in it have resources
    In 94th video we have cut the user class from user.py file and we have pasted in models folder created a new user.py file 
    and we have replaced the user class with UserModel class and changed it where evere we have written user and we have removed the 
    class methods at above because they are using the Item class and replaced each fumction with self (insert_item and update) functions
    and returend each function with json() extension so that json function contain the dictonary of name and values of item
    In 96th video we have make a shotcut of copy and pasting the token as we have inserted a javascript code in test and we have made a jwt_token in the 
    field of token and now it is going to take autometically the generated token cause we have written a code in auth 
    In 98th video we have written a code for Alchemy and we have created columns for both tables and also we have written a code for db.py
    where we have intialised the sqlalchemy.
    In 99th video we have cleared the find_by_name method and we have replace whole Sql queries into a single alchemy query

New things we learned:
    If we want to retriev a class from a folder we type import.user which is a foldername and file name import user which is a 
    class we are going to import.
    Insted of writting http//127.0.5000 we replaced it with {{url}} byplacing a new environment where we placed a new variable as url and 
    intial and current values to http//.127.0.5000
    Thongs a user or item has to be entered is written in models 
    and things which  a user or item will enter will be writte in resources
